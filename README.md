# Digital-Time-Capsule

Digital-Time-Capsule is a customizable digital journal and scrapbook platform designed to help users capture, reflect on, and creatively share life’s moments. More than a standard journaling app, it integrates localized AI tools to enhance photos, suggest creative templates, and generate personalized writing prompts. In addition, we have a Digital Time Capsule feature that allows a user to store and save photos and give them to the recipient at a date of the user's choosing. For example, if the user has a son or daughter, and they wanted to save and preserve memories throughout their entire life until their graduation date when they are 18, this would be an application to do so. 

Whether you’re journaling privately, building a collaborative scrapbook, or preserving memories in a digital time capsule, this platform puts privacy and control back in your hands—offering offline use, flexible export options, and zero targeted ads.
